# Countdown Timer using Python

This project is a simple countdown timer implemented in Python. The code takes input from the user regarding the length of the countdown in seconds and displays a countdown on the screen in the format 'minutes:seconds'. The `time` module is utilized to achieve this functionality.

## Approach

To create the countdown timer, follow the steps below:

1. Import the `time` module.
2. Ask the user to input the length of the countdown in seconds.
3. Convert the input value to an integer, as it is initially stored as a string.
4. Define a user-defined function called `countdown()` that takes the countdown duration as a parameter.
5. Inside the `countdown()` function, use a while loop that runs until the time becomes 0.
6. Use the `divmod()` function to calculate the number of minutes and seconds remaining. This function returns a tuple with the quotient and remainder of the division.
7. Format the minutes and seconds as a string using the `timeformat` variable.
8. Print the minutes and seconds on the screen using the `end='\r'` parameter to overwrite the previous output.
9. Use the `time.sleep()` function to pause the program for one second.
10. Decrement the time by one second to converge the countdown.
11. After the loop completes, print "Fire in the hole" to signify the end of the countdown.

## Usage

To use the countdown timer, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script that contains the countdown timer code.
2. Enter the duration of the countdown in seconds when prompted.
3. The countdown will begin, and the remaining time in the format 'minutes:seconds' will be displayed on the screen.
4. Once the countdown reaches 0, the message "Fire in the hole" will be printed.

Feel free to modify the code according to your needs, such as adding sound effects or customizing the output format.
